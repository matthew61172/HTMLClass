# Tasks

1. None of the CSS is working! It probally isn't linked propperly. Can you fix this?

2. We can't really see the title in the nav bar, there isn't enough contrast. Change the font-color to white so we can see it better. Hint: look for the `.title` id in the CSS.

3. The image for the book 'Everything Is Illuminated' didn't load. Can you work out why and try and fix it. 

4. Can you change the links so their text is all uppercase and when you hover on them they change color?

5. Can you add the book 'The Time Machine - H. G. Wells' (buy now link: "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Machine-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141439971" img link: "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41qWrvBRuTL._SX318_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg")

6. No one knows what this page is about. Can you add a `h2` header with the class `"section-title"` along with a small description in a `p` tag.

7. The 'Buy now' links should open the page in a new tab. Can you change each one so this will happen?

8. The design team are rather picky, they can't stand the typeface being used. Can use 'roboto' from google fonts https://fonts.google.com/ 

9. The page isnt very responsively designed. Can you improve this by making the images 100% of the width for mobile.

10. We are adding a new feature to the page; we want a video of the month section. Can you create a new `section` like all the others and embed a YouTube video in it (choose anyone you want).
